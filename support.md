## Common questions

### Where is my data stored?
All items, photos, and files are stored locally on your device only. Inventory Me does not upload or sync data to any servers.

### Do I need an account?
No. Inventory Me does not require sign-in or account creation.

### Does the app collect or track data?
No. Inventory Me does not collect analytics, usage data, or personal information.

### Can I share items or documents?
Yes. You can share photos or files using Apple’s standard sharing options. Sharing only happens when you choose to do so.

### What happens if I change my phone?
Because data is stored locally, it is your responsibility to ensure your device is backed up using Apple’s backup tools if you want to retain your inventory.
